## Goal of the research
According to extensive previous research, the roles of various physical processes, such as the convection and raditive heating, in the CCKWs have been studies. However, there are still knowledge gaps urgent to address.

For instance, the direct (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2023GL105160">Nakamura and Takayabu (2023)</a>) and the indirect (<a href="https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2011GL049734">Ma and Kuang (2011)</a>) effects of the LW CRF is opposite in the previous sturdies. Nakamura and Takayabu (2023) elucidate positive relation between LW CRF anomalies and specific volume anomalies, which indicating an amplification. Meanwhile, Ma and Kuang (2011) illustrate a bottom-heavy LW CRF profile, and elucidate that the LW CRF will suppress the stratiform heating, and further influence the development of the convection system associated with the CCKWs, acting dampness on the CCKWs.


## Scientific Question
1. What are the direct and indirect impacts of the cloud radiative feedback (CRF) on the behavior of the CCKWs, including phase speed, growth rate, etc.?
2. What are the impact of shallow convecting cumulus on the CCKWs behavior, including phase speed, growth rate, etc.?
3. In warming climate, the convective and radiative condition may vary. What are the potential changes of the CCKWs behavior that resulting from such changes?
